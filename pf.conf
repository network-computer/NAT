# Permit keep-state packets for UDP and TCP on external interfaces
pass out quick on $ext_if proto udp all keep state
pass out quick on $ext_if proto tcp all modulate state flags S/SA

# Permit any packets from internal network to this host
pass in quick on $int_if inet from $int_network to $int_addr

# Permit established sessions from internal network to any (incl. the Internet)
pass in quick on $int_if inet from $int_network to any keep state
# If you want to limit the number of sessions per NAT, nodes per NAT (simultaneously), and sessions per source IP
#pass in quick on $int_if inet from $int_network to any keep state (max 30000, source-track rule, max-src-nodes 100, max-src-states 500 )

# Permit and log all packets from clients in private network through NAT
pass in quick log on $int_if all

# Pass any other packets
pass in all
pass out all
